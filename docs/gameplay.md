## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Pet

When you first run MycoMate, you'll be prompted to name your new mushroom pet. Choose wisely - this name will stay with your pet throughout their entire life!

Your pet starts as a tiny spore with:
- Random personality (shy, playful, curious, sleepy, energetic)
- Random favorite food preference
- Basic starting stats (moderate hunger/happiness, full health/cleanliness)

### Understanding the Interface

The game interface shows:

## Advanced Tips

### Stat Management

- Hunger: 60-90% (avoid overfed and starving)
- Happiness: 70-100% (crucial for mood)
- Health: 80-100% (essential for growth)
- Cleanliness: 70-100% (affects health)
- Energy: 40-100% (needed for activities)

### Time Management

**Daily Routine**:
1. Morning: Check stats, feed if needed
2. Midday: Play session, clean if needed
3. Evening: Feed again, ensure good stats
4. Before bed: Let pet rest

**Weekly Goals**:
- Maintain consistent care
- Build toward next growth stage
- Accumulate experience points
- Monitor long-term health trends

### Mood Optimization

Pet mood is calculated from average of all stats:
- 80-100%: Ecstatic, Joyful, Blissful
- 60-79%: Happy, Content, Cheerful
- 40-59%: Okay, Neutral, Meh
- 20-39%: Sad, Worried, Tired
- 0-19%: Miserable, Sick, Dying

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

**"Pet won't eat!"**
- Check if hunger >85% (pets refuse when full)
- Wait for cooldown period to expire
- Try feeding favorite food

**"Stats dropping too fast!"**
- Normal behavior - pets need regular care
- Check every 3-4 hours minimum
- Focus on the lowest stats first

**"Can't reach Magical stage!"**
- Ensure 72+ hours of age
- Maintain 80%+ health consistently
- Accumulate 500+ experience points
- Be patient - this is the ultimate achievement!

**"Pet seems unhappy despite care!"**
- Check all stats, not just hunger
- Play more often (every 20 minutes when possible)
- Feed favorite foods for happiness bonus
- Ensure cleanliness and energy are maintained

### Save File Issues
