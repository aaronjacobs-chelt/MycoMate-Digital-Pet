## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Pet

When you first run MycoMate, you'll be prompted to name your new mushroom pet. Choose wisely - this name will stay with your pet throughout their entire life!

Your pet starts as a tiny spore with:
- Random personality (shy, playful, curious, sleepy, energetic)
- Random favorite food preference
- Basic starting stats (moderate hunger/happiness, full health/cleanliness)

- Ensure 72+ hours of age
- Maintain 80%+ health consistently
- Accumulate 500+ experience points
- Be patient - this is the ultimate achievement!

**"Pet seems unhappy despite care!"**
- Check all stats, not just hunger
- Play more often (every 20 minutes when possible)
- Feed favorite foods for happiness bonus
- Ensure cleanliness and energy are maintained
